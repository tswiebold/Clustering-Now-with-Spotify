# Clustering-Now-with-Spotify

The project is to display the features of top 20 billboard Spotify songs from 2003 to 2016
through the computational model of k-means in order to create a possible foundation for generating what moods the top songs create. The aim is to see if a simplified version of musical data is sufficient for genre or mood categorization. After the dataset has been clustered through k-means, the two outcome will be tested subjectively to see if it replicated how a human would classify the music. The results will show what features a song needs to be most likely to get onto the top 20 Spotify billboards. The results give clear definitions of what a song needs in order to be on the top 20 billboard hits, so the next exploratory step would be classifying the songs into genres moods based on their features. The outcome of this study created a simplified method of classifying music without the requirement of audio files.
